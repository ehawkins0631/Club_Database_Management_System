Club Database Management System


In this project, I gained more hands-on experience working with a relational database using MySQL Workbench from Oracle. The basic knowledge I learned allowed you to work with any other relational database. At the end of this project, I was able to create a billing report and a club member roster.

Summary:


* Knew what tables are and write basic SELECT statements
* Used wildcard characters for pattern matching, and sorted query results
* Added data to a database with INSERT statements
* Deleted data from a database with DELETE statements
* Joined tables together to produce meaningful reports
